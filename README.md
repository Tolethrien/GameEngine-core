# other
GameEngine will include
- Core - core parts of an engine, like ECS system, inputs handlers and signals, and some basic start to componnets like transforms/physics/renderer
- Editor - Full on editor for engine, so you dont need to write everything with code :) 
- AuroraRenderer - My own custom WEBGPU based renderer for engine, includes uniwersal pipeline that provides a lot of post-proccesing effects, lightings etc.
- Map Creator - Like editor but for making game map :) in the long run it will be marged to the editor itself.
